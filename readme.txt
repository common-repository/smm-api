SMM API Plugin is an API integrator for SMM servers and Re-Sellers panel website that runs in WordPress platform.

== Description ==

This plugin automates the client order processing and Order placing at SMM server. Customer gets an onetime response back for each SMM item that is bought through panel websites. Many SMM servers do not give free plugin for WordPress Sites. Hence I thought to write simple plugin that does online active integration with supporting server sites. It needs a api server url and api key to pull data from server and place order with server from any Re-seller panel WordPress site. The order is displayed in admin page and it will be a List view in admin page. Users can put their own price tag and route orders to server sites with added options available with this plugin. Try free version and learn to use the plugin before you want any advanced features. If you need technical support please mail me at sam@softnwords.com and you get reply in couple of days as there are many emails in mailbox.
